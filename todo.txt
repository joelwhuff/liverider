have the all ui appended to a container element that is passed into game

have chat bubbles above riders as well as an actual chatbox

could redo start position tool and have it move track
    when used it should lock camera to spawn and just move spawn and camera
    and then save the offset which will only move the track when exporting
    save/cancel button where item options usually appear

figure out why rendering looks slightly blurry at lower zoom levels

get rid of all the static get methods for browser compatability

dont use abort controller

make svg images for the item tools and inline all of the svg rather than requesting each from server

make sure tools arent draggable

add item rendering to cell cache

add functionality to Grid.spread so it detects when items should be added to multiple cells
    try to do the same for lines eventually (lines that clip between cells)

try to store polylines in 2darray maybe, could eliminate 2ms+ of moveTo() potentially

make gif of rider donig wheelie to use as loading indicator
