optimization
    get rid of all the static get methods for browser compatability
    make svg images for the item tools and inline all of the svg rather than requesting each from server
    make sure tools arent draggable
    add item rendering to cell cache
    add functionality to Grid.spread so it detects when items should be added to multiple cells
    try to do the same for lines eventually (lines that clip between cells)
    try to store polylines in 2darray maybe, could eliminate 2ms+ of moveTo() potentially
