optimization
    add item rendering to cell cache
    add functionality to Grid.spread so it detects when items should be added to multiple cells
    try to do the same for lines eventually (lines that clip between cells)
    try to store polylines in 2darray maybe, could eliminate 2ms+ of moveTo() potentially
